BootStrap
=========

This started out as a lightweight replacement for those large DI frameworks
when all you need is to wire up a few objects. Features:

- no transitive dependencies apart from scala-library
- can instantiate any POJO (constructor args or bean setters)
- provides Configuration trait for enhancing user experience if desired
- configuration file format extremely easy to read and write

Have Fun!
